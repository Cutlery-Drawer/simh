<h2>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Simulators are a form of “virtual machine” intended to address a simple problem: the absence of real hardware.
Simulators for past systems address the loss of real hardware with time and preserve the usability of software after real hardware has vanished.
Simulators for future systems address the variability of future hardware designs and facilitate the development of software before real hardware exists.</p>
<p>SIMH is a behavioral simulator for obsolete systems of historic interest.
Originally intended as an educational project,
it is increasingly being used in long-lived production environments as a substitute for real systems.
SIMH is continuously being extended to simulate new machines,
a process that requires equal parts of historical research,
software engineering, and detective work.</p>

<section id="a-taxonomy-of-virtual-machines">
<h2>A taxonomy of virtual machines<a class="headerlink" href="#a-taxonomy-of-virtual-machines" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The term “virtual machine” has been used to describe at least three different types of computer programs:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The virtualized computer operating system (hypervisor) pioneered by VM/370 and today commercialized through such products as VMWare.
Virtual hypervisors allow a single system to run multiple operating environments simultaneously.</p></li>
<li><p>The abstract computer system produced by interpreted environments such as Java and C♯ today
(and many other projects in earlier times).
Virtual machine interpreters allow code to be portable across incompatible instruction architectures.</p></li>
<li><p>A simulated or emulated computer system, like SIMH,
which looks back to the behavioral simulators of 35 years ago, such as MIMIC <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id4" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>.
Simulators create virtual machines that can run code for other systems,
typically because the other system no longer exists or does not yet exist.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All virtual machines share a common set of problems:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The virtual system must faithfully reproduce the target.</p></li>
<li><p>The virtual system must be able to faithfully reproduce the environment expected by the software (timing, I/O, etc).</p></li>
<li><p>The virtual system must deliver adequate performance to be a usable environment.</p></li>

<h2>SIMH<a class="headerlink" href="#simh" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>SIMH is an open-source simulation system for obsolete computer systems.
Its purpose is to preserve computing’s legacy,
both hardware and software,
and to make systems of historic interest accessible to anyone with a personal computer.
SIMH consists of a common framework (known as SCP, the Simulator Control Package) and individual simulators for more than 20 systems:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>DEC:</strong> PDP-1, PDP-4, PDP-7, PDP-8, PDP-9, PDP-10, PDP-11, PDP-15, VAX.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data General:</strong> Nova, Eclipse.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>IBM</strong>: 1130, 1401, 1620, System/3.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interdata:</strong> 16b and 32b systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Others:</strong> Royal-Mcbee LGP-30, SDS 940, Honeywell H316, GRI-909.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>SIMH is portable and runs on Windows, Linux and most other flavors of Unix, macOS, and VMS.
The overall design of SIMH has been described elsewhere <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id5" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>;
this article focuses on the practical implementation issues of writing a simulator,
and the common problems that must be solved.</p>
</section>
<section id="writing-a-simulator">
<h2>Writing a simulator<a class="headerlink" href="#writing-a-simulator" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The process of writing a simulator for an obsolete system requires historical research, software engineering, and detective work, in about equal parts.</p>
<section id="step-1-historical-research">
<h3>Step 1: Historical research<a class="headerlink" href="#step-1-historical-research" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The essential basis for any simulator is an accurate specification of the target system.
While modern architectures are specified in great detail,
descriptions of historical systems tend to be sketchy.
In addition, time has created gaps in the historical record:
manuals have been thrown out,
schematics lost,
actual machine examples scrapped.
As in most forms of historical research, primary sources
(for computers, schematics, microcode listings, and maintenance documentation) are best; secondary sources such as handbooks,
marketing material,
textbooks,
and even user manuals cannot be trusted.</p>
<p>The Internet provides multiple starting points for simulation research:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Collectors, universities, and museums have transcribed and published their private archives of documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Search engines can provide pointers to web pages and sites dedicated to historical computing or particular systems of interest.</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation and occasionally complete systems are offered for sale on eBay.</p></li>
<li><p>Several newsgroups are devoted to obsolete systems and emulation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Nonetheless, even for the most popular systems,
survival of hardware and software is chancy.
For example, Unix V1-V4 appears to be irrevocably lost.
On the other hand, the sources for PDP-15 XVM/DOS — not exactly a widely used operating system — turned up in a collection of DECtapes on eBay.</p>
</section>
<section id="step-2-software-engineering">
<h3>Step 2: Software engineering<a class="headerlink" href="#step-2-software-engineering" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once adequate documentation is in hand,
the next stage is designing and implementing the simulator.
Certain design decisions are critical:
How will the hardware system architecture be mapped into software?
How will memory and I/O devices be represented?
How will asynchrony (simulated time) be handled?</p>
<p>SIMH handles these issues as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>SIMH maps the hardware architecture using a variation of PMS (Processor-Memory-Switch) notation <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id6" id="id3" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>3<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>.
Simulators are collections of devices;
the CPU is just a device that executes instructions.
Devices consist of registers, which hold state,
and units, which contain data sets.
For example, a disk controller is a device.
Its registers are the controller state.
The units represent the disk drives,
each of which has a data set.</p></li>
<li><p>SIMH represents memory and I/O data sets by a uniform mapping into host system containers.
All containers are C integer data types.
For example, a 12-bit memory would be represented by a C unsigned short array (typically 16b).
Containers for I/O devices are typically disk files,
although they can also be mapped to real devices,
such as floppy or CD drives.</p></li>
<li><p>SIMH models the asynchronous operation of a computer system explicitly.
The simulator keeps track of simulated time,
in any convenient unit (nanoseconds, instructions).
Devices that operate asynchronously schedule events in “future time”.
When the simulator reaches the appropriate time,
it calls the device event handler to execute the asynchronous operation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once the high-level design issues are decided,
the simulator can be detailed designed and coded,
usually from the CPU out to the peripherals.
The CPU design has the most complexity:
how will instructions be decoded and executed;
how will the CPU communicate with I/O devices;
how are exceptions and interrupts handled;
what debugging facilities should be included?
A typical SIMH simulator handles these issues as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Instruction execution models the behavior of the real system,
with a fetch phase,
an address decode phase,
and instruction execution.
Often, the instruction breakout is simply a large case statement.
This is fast and models the structure of microcode but can be bulky and difficult to read.</p></li>
<li><p>The CPU implements formal, configurable interfaces to I/O devices,
usually with the same basic operations as the real system’s I/O bus.
These interfaces allow an I/O dispatch table to be built at run-time,
so that I/O devices can be included or excluded as desired.</p></li>
<li><p>Exceptions are often handled in the same way they are in the hardware:
by a global trap (C <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">longjmp</span></code>) to a central exception routine.
This is anathema in modern object-oriented languages but accurately models how many real systems work.</p></li>
<li><p>Interrupts are modeled to balance accuracy and simulation speed.
For complex priority interrupt systems,
the best approach is a central routine to evaluate the state of the interrupt system after any event that can change it (for example, an I/O instruction).</p></li>
<li><p>All simulators provide symbolic assembly and disassembly for memory,
execution breakpoints,
single execution step,
and a PC change history.
Some provide deep instruction trace capabilities,
or multiple types of breakpoints.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The simulator is now ready for initial debugging,
with hand test cases,
or diagnostics if available.</p>
</section>
<section id="step-3-detective-work">
<h3>Step 3: Detective work<a class="headerlink" href="#step-3-detective-work" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The last stage is bringing up the operating system and other operational software.
In theory, a simulator that runs diagnostics should run any operating system.
In practice, this isn’t the case, for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>The software may be incomplete.</strong>
Attempts to bring up the PDP-15 Advanced System Software (ADSS) were stymied by lack of the proper paper-tape bootstrap.
Eventually, a PDP-9 bootstrap turned up in France,
but no paper-tape reader was available to transcribe it.
The collector in France scanned the tape in sections on a flatbed scanner and then wrote a program to recognize and transcribe the holes and splice the transcribed sections together.
The PDP-15 simulator writer then discovered,
through debugging the boot process of ADSS,
what changes had occurred between the PDP-9 and PDP-15.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The software path may be untested</strong>
Attempts to bring up PDP-10 TOPS-10 7.04 uncovered a bug in the installation routine’s handling of magnetic tapes.
The “new system” installation path for 7.04 had never been tested,
because by the time 7.04 shipped in 1988,
the PDP-10 had been out of production for six years,
and all installations were upgrades.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The simulator configuration may be untested.</strong>
Simulators are much cheaper than real hardware,
and it’s easy to build a simulated configuration that would have been utterly impractical,
in financial or physical terms, in real life.
For example, initial bring-up of PDP-15 DOS failed when the software attempted to “size” the fixed head disk.
The simulator implemented a maximum sized disk of 2M words (8 platters).
In the real world, no such configuration had ever been built,
because it was too expensive.
The sizing code contained a bug that looped indefinitely on a maximum configuration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The software may depend on details of timing or implementation that are not simulated accurately.</strong>
DEC’s MSCP disk controllers proved particularly difficult to get right.
RSTS/E and RSX11M on the PDP-11,
and NetBSD on the VAX,
had timing dependencies in their MSCP drivers
(and different timing dependencies at that).
As of this writing, there is still a timing problem in the MSCP driver for OpenBSD/VAX, although not for VMS, Ultrix, or BSD 4.3.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In all of these cases, the debug vehicle was an operating system.
Operating systems are great at finding bugs in simulators,
but their reporting mechanisms — hang, crash, or loop — leave something to be desired.
Hence the need for powerful debug tools in the simulator.
The debug tools are not there to debug software but to debug the simulator itself.</p>

<section id="key-issues">
<h2>Key issues<a class="headerlink" href="#key-issues" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Any form of virtual machine must deal with three key issues:
accuracy, software dependencies, and performance.</p>
<section id="accuracy">
<h3>Accuracy<a class="headerlink" href="#accuracy" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>For SIMH, accuracy of simulation has been a key requirement.
This stems from a simple observation:
the more accurate the simulation,
the more software it will run correctly.
The critical choices in implementation are level of simulation (behavioral, register-transfer);
detail of simulation (instruction accurate, cycle accurate);
and specificity of implementation (architectural accuracy, specific model accuracy).</p>
<section id="level-of-simulation">
<h4>Level of simulation<a class="headerlink" href="#level-of-simulation" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Most simulators are behavioral simulators:
they reproduce the behavior of a computer system rather than its internal implementation.
While there are likely to be similarities
(for example, register files abstracted as arrays),
these are coincidental.
No attempt is made to reproduce the “blow by blow” internal operation of the system.
For example, a typical 60s minicomputer would access memory through specific buffer registers:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">MAR</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="n">memory_address</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">MBR</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="n">memory_access</span> <span class="p">();</span>
<span class="n">memory</span> <span class="n">destination</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="n">MBR</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A behavioral simulator abstracts out the intermediate register transfers:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">memory_destination</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="n">memory_access</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">memory</span> <span class="n">address</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In contrast, a register-transfer level simulator does include the details of the hardware intermediate steps.</p>
<p>SIMH is a behavioral system.
Even so, most SIMH simulators follow the hardware flows with great precision and model system structure accurately.</p>
</section>
<section id="detail-of-simulation">
<h4>Detail of simulation<a class="headerlink" href="#detail-of-simulation" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The old saw that “the devil is in the details” is particularly applicable to simulators.
Processor and peripheral behavior needs to be reproduced at a very fine level of detail,
or software will fail to run.
Some examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Every published manual on HP’s 16b computer systems
(the 2100 family, later renamed the 1000 family)
states that the SFS and SFC instructions do not implement the “clear flag” option.
However, the schematics clearly show that these instructions do implement the option;
and HP’s RTE-IV operating system depends on this undocumented feature.</p></li>
<li><p>PDP-11 interrupts were supposed to follow a well-defined model,
but as more and more peripherals were implemented,
deviations from the model arose due to “improvements” or optimizations.
The idiosyncratic interrupt behavior of the PDP-11’s Ethernet and Massbus controllers –
which will not disable a pending interrupt even if interrupt enable flag is cleared –
must be reproduced “bug-for-bug”, or PDP-11 Unix will not run.</p></li>
<li><p>The Honeywell 316 simulator only specifies a small number of the possible bit combinations in the “generic A” operate instruction class.
In order to reproduce the undefined but not unpredictable behavior of the other bit combinations,
the simulator must reproduce the decode logic for the generic A operates signal-by-signal.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this last case, the simulator predicted different results from the only published paper on the subject; and testing on the real hardware proved the simulator to be correct.</p>
</section>
<section id="specificity-of-simulation">
<h4>Specificity of simulation<a class="headerlink" href="#specificity-of-simulation" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Finally, a simulator must reproduce a specific and complete system,
rather than an idealized architectural model.
This is clear enough for early computer systems,
which predate the concept of a compatible computer family;
but it is equally true for well-specified systems.
SIMH doesn’t simulate “the PDP-11” or “the VAX”;
it simulates the PDP-11/73 and the MicroVAX 3900.
Deviations can be perilous:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The PDP-11 architecture did not specify the ordering of decoding and fetching operands in a double operand instruction,
and different PDP-11’s implemented different orderings.
PDP-11 software is not supposed to depend on this ordering.
However, a PDP-11 simulator implementing a specific model must implement double operand processing in the exact right order,
or the “model identification” software in a major operating system (RSX11M+) will not get the right answer.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If differing models are needed to accommodate different software environments –
for example, early PDP-11 UNIX’s run only on the PDP-11/45 –
these must be invoked by specific controls as alternatives to the main simulation environment.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="reproducing-the-machine-environment">
<h3>Reproducing the machine environment<a class="headerlink" href="#reproducing-the-machine-environment" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>SIMH has explicit mechanisms for handling software dependencies on the real machine environment,
such as I/O formats,
I/O timing dependencies,
and real-world timing dependencies.
Handling of I/O formats and asynchronous operations has already been described;
this section focuses on real-world timing dependencies.</p>
<section id="wall-clocks-versus-simulated-clocks">
<h4>Wall clocks versus simulated clocks<a class="headerlink" href="#wall-clocks-versus-simulated-clocks" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Simulated performance varies with the speed of the host processor.
If the simulator keeps track of time by counting instructions or cycles,
then simulated time will run faster on fast machines and slower on slow ones.
This makes it difficult for simulated software to keep track of “wall time”.</p>
<p>SIMH provides calibrated timers.
A periodic event (such as the ticking of the real-time clock) is initially scheduled by guestimate.
As simulation progresses,
SIMH calibrates the clock against wall time and automatically adjusts the simulated delay between clock ticks to approximate real time.</p>
</section>
<section id="timing-loops">
<h4>Timing loops<a class="headerlink" href="#timing-loops" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Some programs, particularly games, require even greater timing accuracy.
For example, PDP-1 Spacewar, the first video game in the world,
runs in a gigantic loop that is speed matched to the performance of a real PDP-1.
If the loop runs too fast –
and on modern hardware a simulated PDP-1 runs 100 times faster than the original –
the spaceships will zoom across the screen and fall into the sun before the user can react.</p>
<p>Simulators can use the calibrated timers,
and the simulator-specific timing mechanism,
to calculate the instruction execution rate.
If this is too high,
the simulator can run idle loops or go to sleep to slow down simulated execution to real world rates.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="performance">
<h3>Performance<a class="headerlink" href="#performance" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<section id="simulated-processor-and-i-o-performance">
<h4>Simulated processor and i/o performance<a class="headerlink" href="#simulated-processor-and-i-o-performance" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Simulators typically take a large number of instructions to execute one simulated instruction:
up to 1000:1 for a complex simulator like the VAX.
On modern computers,
the disparity in clock rates between simulator host and simulated target
(3Ghz for a modern PC versus .8Mhz for a PDP-8 or 5Mhz for a MicroVAX II)
is usually more than sufficient to overcome the adverse simulation ratio.
In addition, I/O on a modern computer is much faster than on historic systems,
due to improvements in peripherals and the copious use of memory for caches and buffers.
Taken together, the improvements can be dramatic:
one SIMH user reported that the running time of a complex program build was reduced from 2.5 hours on a real MicroVAX 3100-38 to 14 minutes on the simulator.</p>
<p>Simulators benefit from improvements in microprocessor performance.
Cache hit rates are high, because the instruction stream is relatively small,
and the data sets are bounded by historic memory sizes.
On the other hand, branches are frequent,
and branch predictability is poor.
In general, simulators run best on microprocessors with high clock rates,
shallow pipelines,
large level-one instruction stream caches,
and large level-two data stream caches.</p>
</section>
<section id="scale">
<h4>Scale<a class="headerlink" href="#scale" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>For historic systems, simulator scale is not an issue,
because the scale is bounded by real system limits.
Simulating a 512MB PDP-11 is not an issue,
because real PDP-11’s were limited to 4MB.
However, simulators are also used to recreate systems of relatively recent provenance,
such as the Hercules’ 370 simulator or the SIMH VAX simulator.
For simulators of modern architectures,
scale is certainly an issue.</p>
<p>In the last year,
users of SIMH VAX requested greater memory and storage capacity than provided by the original target system,
the MicroVAX 3900.
Fortunately, the VAX architecture abstracts the details of memory and storage representation to some extent.
In the VAX architecture,
memory size is presented to an operating system by bootstrap code;
the operating system isn’t required to understand the details of the underlying memory system.
Likewise, in MSCP,
disk drive size is presented to an operating system by the drive itself;
the operating system is expected to handle drives of arbitrary size.
These abstractions allowed expansion of memory from 64MB to 512MB with only changes to the simulator and the boot firmware,
and expansion of drive capacity to 1TB (!) with only changes to the simulator’s I/O routines to handle files larger than 2GB.</p>

<section id="conclusion-avoiding-the-pitfalls">
<h2>Conclusion: avoiding the pitfalls<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion-avoiding-the-pitfalls" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>SIMH has successfully recreated machines covering a 40 year span of computing history,
using a common design and control framework and common implementation techniques.
SIMH can be readily extended to simulate additional systems,
<em>provided</em> that three simple rules are observed:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Research the system to be simulated thoroughly.</p></li>
<li><p>Work through the mapping of the hardware architecture to software structures before starting implementation.</p></li>
<li><p>Run as much real software as possible to debug simulator operations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With a little luck,
and a lot of debugging,
anyone can open another locked treasure from computing’s past.</p>

<section id="possible-sidebar-what-are-these-systems">
<h2>Possible sidebar: what are these systems?<a class="headerlink" href="#possible-sidebar-what-are-these-systems" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>SIMH simulates systems that are of historic interest,
or of architectural interest, or, in many cases, of personal interest to the author.
For example, the LGP-30 was the first computer I ever saw.
Built in the mid 1950s, it used a drum for memory (all 4K words of it).
It had less computing power than today’s disposable calculators.
The IBM 1620 was the first computer I ever programmed.
Built in the late 1950s,
it was popular with universities because of its low cost (only $64,000 – in 1960 dollars).
It implemented decimal arithmetic with table lookups,
leading to the nickname CADET – <em>“Can’t Add, Doesn’t Even Try”</em>.</p>
<p>The PDP-1, an 18b computer delivered in 1960,
was Digital Equipment Corporation’s first computer.
It was used to develop the world’s first video game, Spacewar.
DEC’s PDP-8, a 12b computer delivered in 1966,
was considered the first “minicomputer”,
because it cost less than $20,000 and consisted of only half a rack of logic instead of multiple racks.
The PDP-8 was also the first mass produced computer;
more than 50,000 were manufactured.</p>
<p>The first 16b minicomputers were delivered in the mid to late 1960s.
HP’s 2100,
Interdata’s Model 3,
and Honeywell’s H516 were all early examples of 16b minicomputers.
The H516 was used to implement the Arpanet IMP,
in effect the first router for the predecessor to the Internet.
In 1970, the DEC PDP-11 and Data General Nova revolutionized minicomputer architecture.
The elegant and complex PDP-11 was the most popular minicomputer ever and influenced most late-70s systems,
including the Intel x86;
the x86’s “little endian” byte order derives from the PDP-11.
The radical simplicity of the Nova foreshadowed the RISC architectures of the 1980s.</p>
<p>32b computing broke out of the mainframe category with the introduction of the “supermini” Interdata 7/32 in the mid-70s and then the VAX in 1977.
The 7/32 hosted the first port of Unix,
as well as the first port to a 32b system.
The VAX was the most popular 32b computer of the 1980s,
until overtaken first by RISC and then by PCs.</p>
